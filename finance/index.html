								<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
								<p>We would like to thank the Governor&#8217;s Office of Planning and Research for its contribution to this paper.</p>
								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<h3>Funding and financing</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Funding: Federal and state grants; local revenue; philanthropic sources</li>
									<li>Financing: Government and private financing</li>
								</ul>
								<p>For the last several decades, the State of California has led the nation in the creation of climate policy, starting with progressive energy
									efficiency programs and regulations; followed with legislative work to incentivize the use of renewable sources of energy; and an ambitious
									climate mitigation policy aimed at the rapid reduction of GHG emissions. At the same time, the state is now developing a series of climate
									adaptation programs and strategies with the objective of mitigating the impacts of climate change on the local communities.</p>
								<p>Finance options for local climate adaptation projects do exist from the public and private sectors, and this document aims at identifying
									different modalities of climate adaptation funding.</p>
								<p>The following list serves as a broad overview of notable funding platforms available for local and regional governments, with case studies
									for each that document adaptation finance successes across the country. While most projects incorporate a mix of different mechanisms, many of
									the methods involve innovative tactics applicable to other sectors and reflect growing potential as mainstream alternatives.</p>
								<p>The following list of funding options and examples is not intended to be exhaustive; rather, it is meant to highlight practices that could be
									used to support climate change resilience initiatives. This summary should not be considered policy guidance.</p>
								<p>The following is a list of financial opportunities at state, regional, and local level that can help the implementation of climate adaptation
									programs and strategies in the communities of Southern California.</p>
								<h3>Grants</h3>
								<p>Grants are funds that are not expected to be paid back and are typically awarded by governmental or philanthropic organizations. Since most
									grants are awarded based on a competitive application process, they remain less dependable than other sources of funding. A number of federal
									agencies (e.g. USEPA, Department of Energy), state agencies (e.g. Natural Resources, Public Utility Commission), metropolitan planning
									organizations (e.g. the Southern California Association of Governments, which directs state and federal grants to local agencies), utilities
									(e.g. Southern California Edison), and foundations (e.g. Rockefeller, Kresge, Skoll, Hewlett-Packard) all disperse grants of various sizes for
									projects involving climate adaptation. Please note that grant making priorities change year-by-year, and these opportunities may change.

								</p>
								<h4>State Grants</h4>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<strong>Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) grants, also known as California Climate Investments</strong>: Disadvantaged communities in
										California are specifically targeted for investment of proceeds from the state’s cap-and-trade program. These investments are aimed at
										improving public health, quality of life, and economic opportunity in California’s most burdened communities. The California Global Warming
										Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32) authorizes the cap-and-trade program to deposit some of the funds received from the program into the GGRF and
										appropriated by the legislature. Senate Bill 535 directs that, in addition to reducing GHG emissions, 25% of the proceeds from GGRF must
										also go to projects that provide a benefit to disadvantaged communities. A minimum of 10% of the funds must be for projects located within
										those communities. AB 1550 (2016) adds an additional 5% of funds to benefit low-income households and low-income communities that are
										outside of, but within half a mile of, disadvantaged communities. Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funds are administered by state and local
										agencies for a variety of greenhouse-gas cutting programs, including energy efficiency, public transit, low-carbon transportation, and
										affordable housing. Guidelines written by the Air Resources Board help these agencies develop programs that meet statutory requirements for
										reducing emissions while maximizing the benefits to disadvantaged communities. <em><a
												 href="https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/auctionproceeds/auctionproceeds.htm">Source</a></em>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>California State Coastal Conservancy grants</strong>: Some of these grants are The Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure
										Improvement Act of 2014, also known as Proposition 1, which includes funding to address water quality, water supply, and watershed
										protection and restoration. Chapter 6 of Proposition 1 allocates $100.5 million to the Conservancy for competitive grants for multi-benefit
										ecosystem and watershed protection and restoration projects. The Conservancy has identified four priorities for Proposition 1 expenditures.
										The four priorities project types include: water sustainability improvements, anadromous fish habitat enhancement, wetland restoration, and
										urban greening. <em><a href="http://scc.ca.gov/grants/">Source</a></em>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA) grants</strong>: The CNRA grants are another source of funding for specific projects.
										Right now, The Urban Rivers Grant Program is open for solicitation. This is a competitive grant program for projects that meet at least two
										of the following five statutory conditions: Promote Groundwater Recharge and Water Reuse; Reduce Energy Consumption; Use Soils, Plants, and
										Natural Processes to Treat Runoff; Create, or Restore Native Habitat; and Increase Regional and Local Resiliency and Adaptability to Climate
										Change. <em><a href="http://resources.ca.gov/bonds_and_grants/grant_programs/">Source</a></em>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>California Energy Commission (CEC) grants</strong>: The CEC is committed to helping applicants through the process. Tools and
										resources on this page are designed to help expedite filing an application for approval. New materials and updates get posted as they are
										available.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Eligible Local Educational Agencies (LEAs)</strong>: These agencies – including county offices of education, school districts,
										charter schools, and state special schools – can request funding by submitting an energy expenditure plan application to the California
										Energy Commission. For the first year, there is an option to receive part or all of a school&#8217;s allocation for energy savings planning
										purposes. The Energy Commission approves plans and works with the California Department of Education, which subsequently distributes funds
										after plans have been approved.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>The California Clean Energy Jobs Act (Proposition 39)</strong>: Prop. 39 changed the corporate income tax code and allocates
										projected revenue to California&#8217;s General Fund and the Clean Energy Job Creation Fund for five fiscal years, beginning with fiscal
										year, 2013-14. Under the initiative, roughly up to $550 million annually is available for appropriation by the legislature for eligible
										projects to improve energy efficiency and expand clean energy generation in schools. <em><a
												 href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/efficiency/proposition39/">Source</a></em>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Examples of use of state grants</strong><br>
										State grants often target even more specific projects, as can be seen in the following two examples:
										<ol>
											<li>Climate Adaptation Planning for Silicon Valley: Funded through a grant by the cabinet-level Strategic Growth Council, the Silicon
												Valley 2.0 Project aims to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the South Bay by working towards completing various deliverables.
												These include: preparing a comprehensive climate adaptation plan, conducting a vulnerability risk assessment, launching a decision
												making tool for local jurisdictions and organizations to evaluate climate vulnerability, and drafting a short- and long-term roadmap for
												implementing policies and technological strategies to reach an ambitious midcentury carbon reduction goal. Though managed by the Santa
												Clara County Office of Sustainability, the Strategic Growth Council’s grant truly allowed the project to take form, as the committee
												carried out its mission to ensure that regional sustainability planning efforts meet state emission reduction measures. In addition to
												sustainable planning, the Council also distributes grants for urban greening projects and incentives for collecting planning data.</li>
											<li>Address Sea Level Rise through Science and Policy Support: The California Ocean Protection Council’s Local Coastal Program Sea Level
												Rise Grants dole out over $1 million annually to support coastal adaptation planning, data collection, and policy formulation. The
												state’s grant money originates from the 2008 Proposition 84 coastal protection bond and trust fund for general adaptive management and
												coordination plans. Past and proposed projects include: the City of Eureka’s coastal flood modeling with LIDAR elevation data and
												potentially hydrologic connectivity mapping, Santa Cruz and Monterey County’s sea level rise vulnerability assessments, and Sonoma
												County’s inventories of coastal policies and planning options.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>Private grants</h3>
								<p>Private grants could entail broad and nonspecific project support, but those from local foundations often play a more participatory role and
									act as catalysts for forming public-private partnerships and collaborations. Including local nonprofits in proposals could increase the
									probability of winning grants.</p>
								<h3>Loans</h3>
								<p>Loans are monetary assistance from a government entity, bank, private corporation, or individual specifying the amount of interest, in
									addition to the principal sum, that the borrower will repay by a certain future date. As a prime avenue for completing any costly project,
									different types of loans with various stipulations exist – e.g. see entries for loan guarantees and lines of credit.</p>
								<h3>Rebates and incentives</h3>
								<p>A rebate is a portion of a commodity’s price returned to the buyer after making the full payment. Government entities or private companies
									often give rebate incentives to consumers or commercial enterprises for purchasing clean energy vehicles and energy efficient products.</p>
								<h3>Bonds</h3>
								<p>Bonds are debt instruments that allow governments and other entities to borrow money from investors and repay that investment over a certain
									time at a certain rate. Government bonds often remain tax exempt, meaning the interest that investors earn is tax exempt. Bonds are a very
									traditional and familiar platform for financing public infrastructure and government programs, and recently the market has developed “green”
									bonds to finance green infrastructure. Government bonds may be backed by general funds, or by specific revenue streams, but certain types of
									bonds can also be used to finance private activities that Congress has determined are in the public good, such as pollution control and waste
									management. While private activity bonds have been used heavily to assist California in meeting its recycling mandates, they can also finance
									climate adaptation projects.</p>
								<h3>Loan guarantees</h3>
								<p>A loan guarantee is the one provided by a third-party funder (bank or private party) and guaranteed by a government agency, in which the
									lender agrees to purchase debt in the event that the borrower defaults. Government-guaranteed loans allow financial assistance to flow to
									borrowers perceived as high-risk.</p>
								<h3>Revolving loan fund</h3>
								<p>A funding mechanism typically for water and energy-related improvement projects, whereby loans to local government entities generate loan
									repayments that circulate back into the fund. Once properly seeded with an initial fund, these loan repayments stimulate reinvestment and
									supply funds for continuous additional rounds of financing.</p>
								<p>Agencies at the federal and state level remain the primary but not exclusive source of providers of revolving funds for local governments and
									private sector entities.</p>
								<h3>Credit enhancement</h3>
								<p>Financial support, often in the form of a loan or bond delivered to a lender, intended to give the lender more assurance that the borrower
									will pay its obligation. Governments or other entities can provide lenders like banks with a credit enhancement to encourage lending to
									businesses or projects increasing climate resiliency. Traditional credit enhancements include additional collateral, insurance, guarantees,
									and reserves. However, credit enhancements can take many forms and can be tailored to meet very specific types of programs and program
									outcomes.</p>
								<h3>Property tax and sales tax</h3>
								<p>Local governments can use funds from conventional property and sales taxes for desirable retrofit and resiliency projects. A study called
									“Climate Change Preparedness and Resiliency: Funding and Financing Strategies for New Jersey” by the NJ Climate Adaptation Alliance presents
									an analysis of how state and local governments could fund adaptation projects through these methods, with many California municipalities as
									models. <em><a href="http://njadapt.rutgers.edu/docman-lister/working-briefs/114-climate-additional-report/file">Source</a></em></p>
								<h3>User fees</h3>
								<p>Charges for using public infrastructure (such as a toll road or wastewater plumbing) to cover the system’s annual operating, maintenance, and
									capital expenses. Though not always feasible, increasing the charge of user fees can provide extra revenue to fund new infrastructure
									improvements, so long as long-term project benefits remain substantial and the fees’ target audience remains engaged and receptive.</p>
								<h3>Value capture</h3>
								<p>Creation of a new tax, fee, or revenue-sharing agreement that capitalizes on the increased value of an area or service generated by
									improvement projects, such as new enhanced infrastructure enhancement districts. Examples include establishing a one-time impact mitigation
									fee for new development and creating a voter-approved special tax or assessment district to finance public infrastructure projects and
									facility improvements (outside prior redevelopment areas).</p>
								<p>In California, the Community Facilities Act (more commonly known as Mello-Roos) was a law enacted by the California State Legislature in 1982
									and enabled &#8220;Community Facilities Districts&#8221; (CFDs) to be established by local governments in California as a means of obtaining
									additional public funding. Counties, cities, special districts, joint powers authority, and school districts in California form a CFD to
									finance major improvements and services within the district, which might include schools, roads, libraries, police and fire protection
									services, or ambulance services. The taxes are secured by a continuing lien and are levied annually against property within the district.
									These CFDs must attain two-thirds approval from property owners or registered district voters to institute a new local property tax, while a
									special assessment district requires simple majority approval.</p>
								<h3>Carbon fee</h3>
								<p>A charge on carbon-fueled activities effectively raising the price of fossil fuels to reduce total emissions and encourage clean renewable
									alternatives. The impact of these price hikes on low-income households can be tempered with a host of different strategies including selective
									revenue distributions (dividends) and cutbacks to existing tax rates that hinder job growth (tax-shifting).</p>
								<h3>Off-site Retrofit Program</h3>
								<p>A financing technique for improvement projects whereby reduced resource use produces net monetary savings that pay into a private sector
									fund. This model typically involves water efficiency projects but could also apply to energy retrofits as well. While the viability of
									offsetting initial payments with accumulated near- or medium-term savings depends on the project time frame and financial capacity of private
									sector industries, comprehensive legislation can actualize this type of funding system.</p>
								<h3>Transferable development rights</h3>
								<p>A market-based growth management system whereby land with zoning codes that incentivize development (“receiving areas”) provides landowners a
									source of windfall profits, which the state can then purchase and transfer to landowners with development restrictions (“sending areas” e.g.
									for cropland, forest, or open space). Once a deed restriction is placed on property barred from further development, developers in designated
									districts can purchase the development rights from an environmentally significant area as credits. Often, a specialized bank monitors regional
									development rights and accumulated interest, in addition to overseeing transactions.</p>
								<p>This strategy can prevent development in areas most vulnerable to climate change and even encourage higher-density urban development.</p>
								<h3>Technical assistance programs</h3>
								<p>Services offering comprehensive capacity building for local and regional entities, often able to leverage and tap into unused financial
									resources. Technical development programs work to attract future investment opportunities for local governments by initiating the adaptation
									planning and monitoring often necessary for attaining grants and loans, as well as by supporting a local adaptation knowledge base for
									implementing future projects. The estimated worth of technical assistance can far exceed the actual cost, which regionally-aligned private
									stakeholders frequently cover.</p>
								<h3>Joint procurement/leasing</h3>
								<p>Leasing essential equipment at a fixed rate for a certain period of time, rather than purchasing the equipment outright, eliminates risks
									associated with ownership. These deals often involve low-cost financing due to net tax benefits and are especially desirable because of their
									rapid transaction times and simpler payment methods, making it possible to obtain leased farm irrigation equipment to improve local
									resiliency. <em><a
											 href="https://www.pnc.com/webapp/unsec/CorpMicrositePSAlt.do?siteArea=/pnccorp/PNC/Home/Corporate%20and%20Institutional/Equipment%20Finance/Tools%20and%20Resources/The+Benefits+of+Equipment+Financing">Source</a></em>
								</p>
								<h3>Public-private partnership</h3>
								<p>Partnerships between public and private entities allow pooling of assets, funds, resources, and networks.</p>
								<h3>Line of Credit (LOC)</h3>
								<p>A commitment to finance a borrower for a certain duration at an amount not to exceed a specified sum. The borrower may draw the entire amount
									for the term of the commitment, although it is more common to use the LOC to meet cash needs as they occur. Thus, the LOC could, and most
									likely will, have multiple draw-downs and repayments during its commitment period. The difference between a line of credit and regular loan
									lies in the fact that lenders typically will not charge interest for unused credit once the borrower reduces the loan term. Federal Lines of
									Credit for Infrastructure Upgrades can be used to identify common advantages of this more flexible financial tool when considering large-scale
									infrastructure projects or capital improvements.</p>
								<h3>Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE)</h3>
								<p>A program that allows property owners to fund renewable energy and efficiency projects with virtually no up-front costs. Residential and
									commercial customers in participating regions can pay back these costs over time as a voluntary property tax assessment through their existing
									bill. In addition to 100% financing and flexible payback periods, PACE also allows outstanding payments to transfer to a new property owner if
									the project site is sold. Despite opposition from the Federal Housing Finance Agency as well as mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
									PACE continues to establish a foothold and grow.</p>
								<h3>Community choice aggregation</h3>
								<p>Model for energy production in which local governments or special districts combine their electricity loads in order to purchase or develop
									new sources of energy, all while the existing utility continues to oversee power generation and service delivery. In California, local elected
									representatives vote to join an aggregation, and citizens can choose if they want to opt out of (or in) the program. This method forms a
									locally tailored and competitive low-rate alternative to municipally-owned and investor-owned utilities, as communities can control the power
									source without purchasing or maintaining infrastructure.</p>
								<h3>Power Purchasing Agreement</h3>
								<p>A financing method by which a third-party taxable entity acquires, installs, and operates renewable power (typically solar photovoltaic
									panels) on public grounds. Local governments contractually purchase the electricity from the provider, which in turn receives tax incentive
									benefits. Benefits of using this method to finance and operate renewable energy projects include little initial cost, lower electricity prices
									due to federal tax incentives, and freedom from operational and maintenance upkeep. <em><a
											 href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/46668.pdf">Source</a></em></p>
								<h3>Insurance</h3>
								<p>A form of financial assistance in which policy holders pay pre-disaster premiums with the expectation that in the event of a disaster, the
									insurance carrier will cover a share of the policy holder’s loss. Since not all disaster circumstances qualify for federal and state grants,
									and affected businesses must ultimately repay disaster assistance loans, insurance often offers critical funds for initiating reconstruction
									and recovery.</p>
